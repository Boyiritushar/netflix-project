🎬 Netflix Movies & TV Shows Clustering
👋 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and similarities between different titles.

The goal was to apply unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering) to group similar movies and shows based on their genres, countries, and release years.

As a CSE student exploring data science, I wanted to understand how clustering works in real-world datasets and how data analysis can reveal hidden trends.

The entire project helped me connect theoretical ML concepts with hands-on implementation using Python.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries Used:

pandas, NumPy → for data cleaning and preprocessing

matplotlib, Seaborn → for data visualization

scikit-learn → for building and tuning the K-Means clustering model

These tools helped streamline the end-to-end workflow — from cleaning raw data to visualizing final clusters.

🧩 What I Did

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized inconsistent formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized trends in genres, countries, and release years using Seaborn plots.

Feature Engineering:

Encoded categorical features and scaled numerical data for better model performance.

Model Building:

Applied K-Means clustering to group similar Netflix titles.

Visualization:

Created clear charts and graphs to interpret how movies and TV shows clustered together.

💡 What I Learned

Gained practical experience in the complete data science pipeline — from data collection to model interpretation.

Understood the importance of data preprocessing before applying any machine learning model.

Learned how unsupervised learning works and how clustering helps find hidden relationships in data.

Improved my ability to use Python libraries for real-world data analysis and visualization.

Realized how clustering can be a foundation for a recommendation system, similar to what streaming platforms use.

📊 Results

Successfully created clusters that grouped Netflix content with similar characteristics.

Observed patterns such as:

Certain clusters dominated by Hollywood dramas and thrillers.

Others focused on regional, documentary, or anime content.

The clusters revealed how Netflix’s library varies across genres and countries.

Overall, the model provided a data-driven perspective on Netflix’s diverse content.

🚀 Future Ideas

Experiment with other clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering.

Build a content recommendation system using similarity scores between clustered titles.

Create an interactive Streamlit dashboard to explore clusters dynamically.

Add more advanced visualizations and integrate user ratings for deeper insights.
